# CultureConnect Machine Learning

Focusing on the machine learning aspects of our project **CultureConnect**, an app designed to help users understand their emotions and discover suitable cafe recommendations based on their mood.



## ðŸ“Š Tasks

### **1. Data Collection:**
- Collect mood-related text data from various sources.
- Gather cafe information tailored to different emotional states.
- Compile a comprehensive dataset of emotional expressions and cafe environments.

### **2. Data Labeling:**
- Label the dataset with the following mood categories:
  - Sadness
  - Joy
  - Love
  - Anger
  - Fear
  - Surprise


### **3. Modeling:**
Build three distinct models:
- **Mood Detection Model:** Utilize the Bidirectional LSTM with Embedding Neural Network architecture for emotion classification.
- **Cafe Recommendation Model:** Implement content-based filtering using TensorFlow and cosine similarity.
- **Text Summarization:** Fine-tune the architecture to generate mood-based insights.


## ðŸ”§ Model Architecture
- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Text data is tokenized and padded for uniform input sequences.
  - Employed one-hot encoding for mood labels.

- **Mood Detection Model:**
  - Built using a sequential neural network architecture:
    - **Embedding Layer:** Maps words to dense vector representations.
    - **Bidirectional LSTM:** Captures both past and future dependencies in text.
    - **Global Max Pooling Layer:** Aggregates sequence information.
    - **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers for classification.
  - Optimized using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

- **Cafe Recommendation System:**
  - Employs cosine similarity to match user moods with cafe data embeddings.
  - Determines recommendations based on user reviews and lighting levels of cafes.

## ðŸ“ƒ Dataset
- **Mood Detection Training Data:** Labeled and weighted text data.
- **Cafe Recommendation Database:** Information on cafes, including names, locations, ratings, and emotional suitability.
